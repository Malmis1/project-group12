# Design guideline

TODO: Write a design guideline based on the following points (taken from `Blackboard > Learning materials >
Week_5`):

## Theme

The learning portal should be designed to be serious and is meant for professionals. There is still room for some playfulness, as to not be boring.

## Color scheme

The main color chosen for the website is orange along with blue as a complimentary accent color. The orange color contributes to giving cheerfulness, creativity, friendliness, confidence and courage. It also draws attention without being overpowering.

## Hierarchy and layout

The most essential information and functionality is located at the topmost of each page. Generally, the main page has a hero section, a general overview of some courses, and some extra functionality or information underneath. Pages will also have a header and footer that are located at the topmost and bottommost of the page respectively. The header contains the most essential information and functionality, such as the logo, search bar, log in/sign up and shopping cart. The footer contains links to various information (for example: policies, contact information, sitemap, etc...) as well as a disclaimer that describes the webpage being a result of a group project. Generally, each section will have layouts that suits the contents inside. For example, using grid layout for the overview over courses, or centered contents inside the hero section.

## Images

The images used for the pages should be suitable for the theming. Images that contribute to functionality will have alternative texts that describes the contents of the image. Text and other elements can be overlaid over certain images (as background), such as in the hero section. Generally, text and other elements should be kept to the side of images. Filters and blur can be used on certain images to improve the visibility of text or other overlaid elements, but should not be used frequently.

## Icons

A favicon will be used for the website (which is visible in the corresponding tab in the web-browser). Icons can be used for logos, such as the logo for the main page. Icons can contain colors that fit the theme.

## Typography

TODO: Write guideline for typography.

- Font Sizes and Styles
- Alignment

## Border rounding

Functional elements are rounded slightly in order to give a friendlier feel to the site.

## Shadows

There should be minimal usage of shadows. Shadows adds playfulness that does not fit the theme as much. Although, shadows can be used for adding some stand out elements of the page.



TODO: Further specify the technical decisions (comes later after implementing the site).
