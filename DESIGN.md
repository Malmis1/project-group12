# Design guideline

TODO: Write a design guideline based on the following points (taken from `Blackboard > Learning materials >
Week_5`):

## Theme

The learning portal should be designed to be serious and is meant for professionals. There is still room for some playfulness, as to not be boring.

## Color scheme

The main color chosen for the website is orange along with blue as a complimentary accent color. The orange color contributes to giving cheerfulness, creativity, friendliness, confidence and courage. It also draws attention without being overpowering.

## Hierarchy and layout

TODO: Write guideline for hierarchy and layout.

The most essential information and functionality is located at the topmost of the landing page.

## Images

TODO: Write guideline for images.

Images will have alternative texts that describes the contents of the image.

## Icons

A favicon will be used for the website (which is visible in the corresponding tab in the web-browser).

## Typography

TODO: Write guideline for typography.

- Font Sizes and Styles
- Alignment


## Border rounding

Functional elements are rounded in order to give a friendlier feel to the site.

## Shadows

TODO: Write guideline for shadows.

According to the theme there will be no use of shadows as it will not suite this site.



TODO: Further specify the technical decisions (comes later after implementing the site).
