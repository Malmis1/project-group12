# Design guideline

TODO: Write a design guideline based on the following points (taken from `Blackboard > Learning materials >
Week_5`):
1. Theme: how serious or playful the design should be
2. Color scheme:
    - Does the company have a color scheme?
    - Which colors are suggested by the theme of the site?
    - Pick the main color
    - Pick an accent color (optional)
3. Hierarchy and layout:
    - What is the most important message/product on the page?
    - What is the order of importance for the different elements?
    - What sections will there be on the page?
    - What layout(s) will you use for the sections?
4. Images:
    - Gather the available images
    - Will there be text on images or aside images?
    - Will we use clear images or a color-overlay?
    - Will there be blur for images?
5. Icons:
    - Will we use icons and for what?
    - Colored or black-and-white/greyscale icons?
6. Typography:
    - Should it by a Serif or Sans-Serif font?
    - Bold or thin font?
    - Rounded or sharp edges?
7. Border rounding:
    - How rounded should be the edges, according to the theme?
8. Shadows:
    - How much shadow will we use in general, according to the theme?

TODO: Further specify the technical decisions (comes later after implementing the site).
