# Design guideline

TODO: Write a design guideline based on the following points (taken from `Blackboard > Learning materials >
Week_5`):

## Theme

The learning portal should be designed to be serious and is meant for professionals. There is still room for some playfulness, as to not be boring.

## Color scheme

The main color chosen for the website is orange along with blue as a complimentary accent color. The orange color contributes to giving cheerfulness, creativity, friendliness, confidence and courage. It also draws attention without being overpowering.

## Hierarchy and layout

TODO: Write guideline for hierarchy and layout.

The most essential information and functionality is located at the topmost of the landing page.

## Images

TODO: Write guideline for images.

The images used for the pages should be suitable for the theming. Images will have alternative texts that describes the contents of the image.

## Icons

A favicon will be used for the website (which is visible in the corresponding tab in the web-browser).

## Typography

TODO: Write guideline for typography.

- Font Sizes and Styles
- Alignment

## Border rounding

Functional elements are rounded slightly in order to give a friendlier feel to the site.

## Shadows

There should be minimal usage of shadows. Shadows adds playfulness that does not fit the theme as much. Although, shadows can be used for adding some stand out elements of the page.



TODO: Further specify the technical decisions (comes later after implementing the site).
