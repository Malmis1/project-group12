# Project

Course project for the courses [IDATA2301 Web technologies](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2301) and [IDATA2306 Application Development](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2306).

This project involves creating a marketplace website with basic functionality for viewing and "purchasing" courses.

***These websites are a result of a university group project, performed in the courses [IDATA2301 Web technologies](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2301) and [IDATA2306 Application Development](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2306), at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/). All the information provided here is a result of imagination. Any resemblance with real companies or products is a coincidence.***

## Running the spring application

The spring application can be run by running the `main` method in the [CoursesApplication](./backend\src\main\java\no\ntnu\courses\CoursesApplication.java) class.
